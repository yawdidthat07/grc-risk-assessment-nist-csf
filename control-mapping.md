# Security Control Mapping – NIST CSF

## Objective
To map identified security risks to relevant governance and security controls
aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## Sample Control Mapping

### Access Control
- NIST CSF Function: Protect (PR.AC)
- Control Objective: Ensure access to systems and data is authorized and reviewed
- Evidence:
  - User onboarding and offboarding procedures
  - Role-based access documentation

### Policy Management
- NIST CSF Function: Identify (ID.GV)
- Control Objective: Maintain up-to-date security policies and governance standards
- Evidence:
  - Approved security policies
  - Policy review and revision history

### Audit Readiness
- NIST CSF Function: Identify (ID.GV)
- Control Objective: Ensure documentation and evidence support audit requirements
- Evidence:
  - Risk registers
  - Control documentation
  - Audit response records

## Notes
Control mapping ensures traceability between risks, controls,
and governance requirements, supporting compliance and audit activities.
