# GRC Risk Assessment – NIST CSF

This repository demonstrates a practical approach to conducting
governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) activities aligned with the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## What’s Included
- Structured risk assessment methodology
- Sample risk register with impact and likelihood
- Control mapping to governance requirements
- Clear documentation designed for non-technical stakeholders

## Purpose
This project reflects how I approach security risk in real-world,
regulated environments — focusing on clarity, documentation, and
actionable outcomes rather than tools alone.
