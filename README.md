# GRC Risk Assessment – NIST CSF

This repository demonstrates a practical, documentation-driven approach to
Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

The focus of this project is on structured risk identification, control mapping,
and clear communication of security risk in regulated environments.

## What’s Included
- A high-level security risk assessment aligned to NIST CSF
- A sample risk register documenting identified risks, impact, and mitigation
- Control mapping to governance and compliance requirements
- Clear, non-technical documentation suitable for audits and leadership review

## Methodology
Risks were identified through a review of people, process, and technology controls.
Each risk was evaluated based on likelihood and impact, then mapped to relevant
NIST CSF functions and categories.

## Purpose
This project reflects how I approach GRC work in real-world environments:
prioritizing clarity, traceability, and actionable outcomes over tools alone.
It is designed to support audit readiness, risk-informed decision making,
and cross-functional collaboration.
